# Feature Requests

## Parking Chaos Rating

Parent-sourced intel on how bad the school gate situation actually is. Include ratings for drop-off and pick-up chaos, parking availability, road congestion, and any known restrictions or hazards around the school entrance.

## Class Size Trends

Track year group and class sizes over time. Is the school growing or shrinking? A shrinking school may face funding pressure. Show trends across recent years so parents can spot patterns — expanding schools may mean larger classes, while shrinking ones may signal declining popularity or future viability concerns.

## Holiday Club Availability

Not just term-time breakfast and after-school clubs, but what's available during school holidays on or near the school site. Include provider names, age ranges covered, hours, costs, and whether the school itself runs the provision or an external operator uses the premises.

## Term-Time Absence Policy

How strict each school is about authorising absences during term time. Show whether the school issues fines for unauthorised absences (and at what threshold), their policy on holidays during term, and their overall unauthorised absence rate from published DfE data. Some schools fine after a single day, others use more discretion — this matters for families who need flexibility for religious observances, family events, or cheaper holiday bookings.

## Uniform Cost & Appearance

Give parents an idea of what the uniform looks like and how much it costs. Show images or a description of the required uniform (colours, style, whether a blazer or tie is needed). Indicate whether items must be bought from a specific supplier (often more expensive) or if supermarket/generic equivalents are acceptable. Include approximate costs for a full set — polo shirts, jumpers, trousers/skirts, PE kit, school bag, coat. Flag schools with expensive branded requirements versus those with a simple, affordable dress code.

## Link to Prospectus

Provide a direct link to each school's prospectus or welcome pack on the school detail page. Many schools publish a PDF prospectus on their website covering ethos, curriculum, facilities, and photos — surface this so parents can access it in one click rather than hunting through the school's website. Where no prospectus is available, link to the school's "About Us" or admissions page as a fallback.

## Admissions Criteria Breakdown

_Extends existing Feature 8 (Waiting List Estimator) which already covers last distance offered, trend analysis, waiting list movement, and appeals success rate._

Add a visual breakdown of each school's oversubscription priority order — the ranked criteria that determine who gets a place when the school is full. Show the priority tiers clearly (e.g., 1. Looked-after children, 2. Siblings, 3. Distance). For faith schools, surface what level of religious practice is expected (regular attendance, baptism certificate, priest's reference). Flag schools that require a supplementary information form (SIF) on top of the standard council application, so parents don't miss a deadline. This complements the existing waiting list estimator by showing _why_ a child might or might not get in, not just the statistical likelihood.

## School Bus Routes

_Extends existing Feature 9 (School Run Journey Planner) which covers walking, cycling, driving, and public transport routing._

Show dedicated school bus routes where schools or councils provide them. Overlay bus routes on the map with stop locations, pick-up times, and eligibility criteria (some are distance-based or only for certain year groups). Include cost if applicable — some councils provide free transport beyond a certain distance (typically 2+ miles for primary, 3+ miles for secondary). Flag whether a bus stop is within walking distance of the parent's postcode. For private schools, show any private coach services, routes, and fees.

## Ofsted Trajectory & Last Inspection

_Extends existing Feature 7 (Reviews, Ratings & Performance) which shows the current Ofsted rating and inspection date._

Show the full Ofsted rating history for each school, not just the current rating. Display a trajectory indicator — is the school improving (e.g., Requires Improvement to Good), stable, or declining (e.g., Outstanding to Good)? The direction of travel matters as much as today's rating. Flag schools where the last inspection was over 5 years ago, as the current rating may be stale and an inspection could be imminent. Show the date of the last inspection prominently so parents can judge how current the rating is. Where available, surface key quotes from the most recent Ofsted report (strengths and areas for improvement) so parents get the flavour without reading the full document.

## School Ethos One-Liner

Display a short, at-a-glance summary of each school's ethos on the school card and detail page — pulled from the school's own website or prospectus (e.g., "Nurturing creativity and independence", "Traditional values with high academic expectations", "Inclusive, play-based learning"). Helps parents quickly get a feel for the school's culture without clicking through to a full prospectus.

## Additional Decision Support Weighting Sliders

_Extends existing Feature 10 (Decision Support Page) which has weighted scoring for distance, rating, clubs, and fees._

Add the following weighting sliders so parents can fine-tune how schools are ranked on the decision support page:

- **Ofsted trajectory** — weight improving schools higher than stable ones at the same current rating
- **Attendance rate** — school culture and engagement signal
- **Class size** — trade-off between smaller classes (more attention) and larger school resources
- **Parking/drop-off ease** — daily quality-of-life factor based on chaos rating data
- **Holiday club on-site** — critical for working parents without nearby family support
- **Uniform affordability** — for budget-conscious families comparing total costs
- **Demographic diversity** — for parents who value a mixed school environment
- **Sibling priority strength** — weight schools where younger children are more likely to follow
- **School run ease** — combines journey time, walking safety, and transport options into one slider
- **Homework intensity** — toggle between preferring more structured homework or a lighter approach

## Private School Hidden Costs

_Extends existing Feature 5 (Private Schools) which shows termly/annual fees, hours, and transport._

Surface the costs that aren't in the headline fee. Many parents are caught off guard by extras that can add thousands per year. Break down: school lunches (often not included, ~£200-300/term), compulsory trips and residentials, exam entry fees, textbooks and materials, individual music tuition, sport fixtures transport, uniform from designated suppliers, registration and deposit fees, insurance levies, and building/development fund contributions. Show an estimated "true annual cost" alongside the advertised fee so parents can compare like-for-like across schools. Where possible, flag which extras are genuinely optional versus effectively compulsory.

## School Demographics

Show the demographic profile of each school using published DfE school census data. Include ethnic diversity breakdown, percentage of pupils with English as an additional language (EAL), percentage eligible for free school meals (a proxy for socioeconomic mix), and percentage with SEND support. Present this clearly and without judgement — some parents actively seek diverse, mixed environments while others want to understand the community their child will be part of. Allow comparison across shortlisted schools so parents can see how demographics differ between nearby options.
