# Feature Requests

## Parking Chaos Rating

Parent-sourced intel on how bad the school gate situation actually is. Include ratings for drop-off and pick-up chaos, parking availability, road congestion, and any known restrictions or hazards around the school entrance.

## Class Size Trends

Track year group and class sizes over time. Is the school growing or shrinking? A shrinking school may face funding pressure. Show trends across recent years so parents can spot patterns — expanding schools may mean larger classes, while shrinking ones may signal declining popularity or future viability concerns.

## Holiday Club Availability

Not just term-time breakfast and after-school clubs, but what's available during school holidays on or near the school site. Include provider names, age ranges covered, hours, costs, and whether the school itself runs the provision or an external operator uses the premises.

## Term-Time Absence Policy

How strict each school is about authorising absences during term time. Show whether the school issues fines for unauthorised absences (and at what threshold), their policy on holidays during term, and their overall unauthorised absence rate from published DfE data. Some schools fine after a single day, others use more discretion — this matters for families who need flexibility for religious observances, family events, or cheaper holiday bookings.

## Uniform Cost & Appearance

Give parents an idea of what the uniform looks like and how much it costs. Show images or a description of the required uniform (colours, style, whether a blazer or tie is needed). Indicate whether items must be bought from a specific supplier (often more expensive) or if supermarket/generic equivalents are acceptable. Include approximate costs for a full set — polo shirts, jumpers, trousers/skirts, PE kit, school bag, coat. Flag schools with expensive branded requirements versus those with a simple, affordable dress code.

## Link to Prospectus

Provide a direct link to each school's prospectus or welcome pack on the school detail page. Many schools publish a PDF prospectus on their website covering ethos, curriculum, facilities, and photos — surface this so parents can access it in one click rather than hunting through the school's website. Where no prospectus is available, link to the school's "About Us" or admissions page as a fallback.

## Admissions Criteria Breakdown

_Extends existing Feature 8 (Waiting List Estimator) which already covers last distance offered, trend analysis, waiting list movement, and appeals success rate._

Add a visual breakdown of each school's oversubscription priority order — the ranked criteria that determine who gets a place when the school is full. Show the priority tiers clearly (e.g., 1. Looked-after children, 2. Siblings, 3. Distance). For faith schools, surface what level of religious practice is expected (regular attendance, baptism certificate, priest's reference). Flag schools that require a supplementary information form (SIF) on top of the standard council application, so parents don't miss a deadline. This complements the existing waiting list estimator by showing _why_ a child might or might not get in, not just the statistical likelihood.

## School Demographics

Show the demographic profile of each school using published DfE school census data. Include ethnic diversity breakdown, percentage of pupils with English as an additional language (EAL), percentage eligible for free school meals (a proxy for socioeconomic mix), and percentage with SEND support. Present this clearly and without judgement — some parents actively seek diverse, mixed environments while others want to understand the community their child will be part of. Allow comparison across shortlisted schools so parents can see how demographics differ between nearby options.
