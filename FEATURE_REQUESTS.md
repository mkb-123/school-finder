## Parking Chaos Rating

Parent-sourced intel on how bad the school gate situation actually is. Include ratings for drop-off and pick-up chaos, parking availability, road congestion, and any known restrictions or hazards around the school entrance.

## Class Size Trends

Track year group and class sizes over time. Is the school growing or shrinking? A shrinking school may face funding pressure. Show trends across recent years so parents can spot patterns — expanding schools may mean larger classes, while shrinking ones may signal declining popularity or future viability concerns.

## Holiday Club Availability

Not just term-time breakfast and after-school clubs, but what's available during school holidays on or near the school site. Include provider names, age ranges covered, hours, costs, and whether the school itself runs the provision or an external operator uses the premises.

## Term-Time Absence Policy

How strict each school is about authorising absences during term time. Show whether the school issues fines for unauthorised absences (and at what threshold), their policy on holidays during term, and their overall unauthorised absence rate from published DfE data. Some schools fine after a single day, others use more discretion — this matters for families who need flexibility for religious observances, family events, or cheaper holiday bookings.
